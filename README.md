```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

#### apps:

- `web`: A [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) app with [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/), and [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/)
- `server`: A simple [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/)-powered server that exposes APIs for the web app

#### packages:

- `ui`: a stub Vue component library shared by both `web` and other Vue3-based applications
- `eslint-config`: shared ESLint configuration used across projects
- `tsconfig`: shared tsconfig.json configurations used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
